# YelpCamp

I made this multi-page responsive website under my online web development course.
The stack used in this project was MEN (MongoDB, Express, NodeJS) Stack.
I used Bootstrap for the layout elements and responsiveness.
It also includes authentication using Passport.

Deployed on Heroku under the URL: http://yelpcamp-lss.herokuapp.com
